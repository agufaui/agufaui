# icons

100,000+ icons from 100+ icons sets are unified by [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) with same syntax. [Unocss](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) furthered it by making these icons available through CSS by means of Data URIs.

You can see and search all icons at [icones.js.org/](https://icones.js.org/). Vscode extension [Iconify IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.iconify) will also help visualize icons.

It doesn't mean you have to use Unocss, any css icons library will also work with AgufaUI. It's just that Unocss is the first to have pure css icons, and the only one on the market at this time of making of AgufaUI. I'm sure other css frameworks will catch up.
